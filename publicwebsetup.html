Your new <B>www</B> directory has been successfully created and added to the www.public.asu.edu Web server. This page, named <B>index.html</B> has been created and saved in your www directory, which is /afs/asu.edu/users/i/u/l/iullah/www. You may begin adding and editing documents in your Web space immediately. To make your home page come up in place of this one, name your home page <b>index.html</b> before you upload it.

<p>

There's some information you'll need to know about publishing your pages on this Web server. Start with the "additional instructions" on this page. After reading them carefully, you may still have questions. They're probably answered in our Frequently Asked Questions page and other first-timer resources at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/jukebox/intro/">http://www.asu.edu/jukebox/intro/</a>.
