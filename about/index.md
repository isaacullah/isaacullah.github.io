I am an Associate Professor of Anthropology at [San Diego State University](https://anthropology.sdsu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I study the long-term effects of human land-use decisions and the bidirectional feedbacks between humans and environments. I am particularly interest in early farming and pastoralism and how these first food producing socio-natural systems evolved over time. I am a [computational archaeologist](https://isaacullah.github.io/What-is-Computational-Archaeology/){:target="_blank"}, and use a combination of traditional archaeological and geoarchaeological approaches in connection with GIS, computational modeling, and computer simulation to investigate the dynamics of these systems. My work is largely based in a complex adaptive systems theory perspective.

<br>
In addition to these large human-environment interaction studies, I also study households, and how people arrange and use their domestic spaces. I analyze the spatial patterning of very small artifacts ("micro-refuse") recovered from ancient house floors as a way to get at long-term patterns in domesticity.

<br>
I am also affiliated with the [Center for Climate and Sustainability Studies](https://c2s2.sdsu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at SDSU and the [Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity](https://csdc.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Arizona State University. Additional affiliations include the [CMSDS](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page), [COMSeS/Open-ABM](https://www.openabm.org/comses){:target="_blank"}, [CHANS-net](https://chans-net.org/){:target="_blank"}, and the [Society for American Archaeology](www.saa.org){:target="_blank"}.

In my spare time, I like taking [photographs](/photography/index.html){:target="_blank"}.
