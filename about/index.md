I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at Arizona State University, studying the long term effects of human landuse decisions, especially those associated with Neolithic farming and pastoralism. I use a combination of traditional archaeological and geoarchaeological approaches with GIS, computational modeling, and computer simulation to investigate the dynamics of agropastoral socio-natural systems. My work is largely based in a complex adaptive systems theory perspective.

In addition to these large human-environment interaction studies, I also study households, and how people arrange and use their domestic spaces. I analyze the spatial patterning of very small artifacts ("micro-refuse") recovered from ancient housefloors as a way to get at long-term patterns in domesticity.

It is with great pleasure that I can also now announce that starting in Fall, 2016, I will be joining the faculty in the [Department of Anthropology at San Diego State University](http://anthropology.sdsu.edu/). There, I will also be affiliated with the [Center for Climate and Sustainability Studies](http://c2s2.sdsu.edu/), and I look forward to working with my new colleagues and students.

In my spare time, I like taking [photographs](/photography/index.html).
