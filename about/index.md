I am an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at [San Diego State University](http://anthropology.sdsu.edu/). I study the long-term effects of human land-use decisions and the bidirectional feedbacks between humans and environments. I am particularly interest in early farming and pastoralism and how these first food producing socio-natural systems evolved over time. I use a combination of traditional archaeological and geoarchaeological approaches in connection with GIS, computational modeling, and computer simulation to investigate the dynamics of these systems. My work is largely based in a complex adaptive systems theory perspective.

<br>
In addition to these large human-environment interaction studies, I also study households, and how people arrange and use their domestic spaces. I analyze the spatial patterning of very small artifacts ("micro-refuse") recovered from ancient house floors as a way to get at long-term patterns in domesticity.

<br>
I am also affiliated with the [Center for Climate and Sustainability Studies](http://c2s2.sdsu.edu/) at SDSU and the [Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity](https://csdc.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University. Additional affiliations include the [CMSDS](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page), [COMSeS/Open-ABM](https://www.openabm.org/comses), [CHANS-net](http://chans-net.org/), and the [SAA](www.saa.org).

In my spare time, I like taking [photographs](/photography/index.html).
