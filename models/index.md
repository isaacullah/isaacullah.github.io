## List of Web-Based Models

These are models that I host here for my classes. Some are made or modified by me, others I am re-hosting for convenience. To run each model, just click the link and it will load in a ne tab. The credits and instructions are in the "Info" tab for each model (bottom of the page).

## NetLogo Models for Class that are not web-based

The NetoLogo software will run on Mac, Windows, and Linux systems (sorry, no Chromebooks or iPads!). First [download NetLogo 6.1.1](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml). These models will likely not run in earlier versions of NetLogo.

Download these .zip archives, and unzip them on your computer (for help with .zip files on Mac and Windows (read this article)[https://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/how-to-zip-and-unzip-files/]). **It's important to keep all the files in the archive together in the same folder when you unzip them.** You can run the models by using the File > Open function in NetLogo, and then navigating to the ".nlogo" file from the model you want to run.

- [The BACO Model](BACO.zip)
- [City Sandbox](City_Sandbox.zip)
- The Urban Sprawl model is included in NetLogo as a sample model. Go to File > Model Library, and search for "Urban Sprawl"

## Building a Simple NetLogo Model

Come back for an updated tutorial for building a simple model of human movement/dispersal courtesy of [Dr. Iza Romanowska](https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/iromanowska@aias.au.dk) and [Dr. Colin Wren](https://anthropology.uccs.edu/colin-wren). It will be an updated version of their [dispersal tutorial](https://simulatingcomplexity.wordpress.com/2014/07/14/netlogo-tutorial-dispersal/) found on [Simulating Complexity](https://simulatingcomplexity.wordpress.com/).
