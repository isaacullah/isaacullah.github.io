## List of Web-Based Models

These are models that I host here for my classes. Some are made or modified by me, others I am re-hosting for convenience. To run each model, just click the link and it will load in a ne tab. The credits and instructions are in the "Info" tab for each model (bottom of the page).

## NetLogo Models for Class that are not web-based

First [download NetLogo 6.1.1](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml). These models will likely not run in earlier versions of NetLogo.

Download these .zip archives, and unzip them on your computer. It's important to keep all the files in the archive together when you unzip them. You can run the models by using the File > Open function in NetLogo, and then navigating to the ".nlogo" file from the model you want to run.

- [The BACO Model](BACO.zip)
- [City Sandbox](City_Sandbox.zip)
- The Urban Sprawl model is included in NetLogo. Go to File > Model Library, and search for "Urban Sprawl"
