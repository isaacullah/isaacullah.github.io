The Computational Archaeology Laboratory at San Diego State University is a state of the art facility for FOSS GIS, agent-based modeling, imagery analysis, and other computational approaches in archaeology. A main focus of research is on the origins and long-term dynamics of coupled human and natural systems in the Mediterranean and beyond.

### Lab Information

**Location:** *Hardy Tower 62/66.* 
<br>
The lab is located on the ground floor of the Hardy Tower building. Students should enter through HT 62 door in the stairwell (look for "Computational Archaeology Laboratory" signs).
<br>
<br>
**Supervised Lab Hours:** *Thursdays, 1-3pm (Spring 2020).* 
<br>
These are the "open lab" hours during which I will regularly be in the lab and available to answer questions. The lab may be open at other times.

### Research

**Research topics.**
<br>
The Computational Archaeology Lab lab conducts research into the following topics:

* Coupled human-natural systems research
* Anthropogenic landscapes, sediments, and soils
* The dynamics of agro-pastoral landuse and subsistence
* Long-term human socio-ecology

The Lab specializes in the following techniques

* GIS and spatial analysis
* Agent-Based Modeling
* 3D and multispectral imaging
* Sediment analysis and geomorphology
* Scientific computing and machine learning

**Collaborations.**
<br>
The Computational Archaeology Lab conducts research in collaboration with the following projects. Please visit these links for more information on each specific project.

### Students

The Computational Archaeology Lab provides computing and other resources for undergraduate and graduate student research in the fields of Computational Archaeology and Geoarchaeology. There are ongoing opportunities for undergraduate student research volunteers and internships (for credit). There may be a limited number of paid hourly positions as well. Please [email me](iullah@sdsu.edu) if you are interested.
<br>
**Prospective Master's Students**
<br>
I am currently seeking prospective MA students interested in the fields of [_Computational or Digital Archaeology_](http://isaacullah.github.io/What-is-Computational-Archaeology/), [_Geoarchaeology_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoarchaeology), and [Landscape Archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_archaeology). I am particularly interested in students with some background in GIS or other computational approaches and/or the geosciences. I have ongoing research opportunities for students interested in working in the Mediterranean region, San Diego County, or in Central Eurasia. I have active fieldwork in Southern Italy and in San Diego County, and other opportunities may also include Spain, Jordan, or Kazakhstan. Interested prospective students should [email me](iullah@sdsu.edu) to discuss potential thesis topics further. You are also advised to visit the main [Anthropology MA program page](http://anthropology.sdsu.edu/graduate/index.html) for more information about our graduate studies program.
