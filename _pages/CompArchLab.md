The Computational Archaeology Laboratory at San Diego State University is a state of the art facility for computational approaches in archaeology and geoarchaeology. Specialties include GIS, agent-based modeling, imagery analysis, advanced statistical modeling, 3D analysis, as well sedimentology, granulometry, geomorphology, landscape analysis, and geochronology. A main focus of research is on the origins and long-term dynamics of coupled human and natural systems, including anthropogenic landscapes, in the Mediterranean and beyond.

### Students

The Computational Archaeology Lab provides computing and other resources for undergraduate and graduate student research in the fields of Computational Archaeology and Geoarchaeology. There are ongoing opportunities for undergraduate student research volunteers and internships (for credit). There may be a limited number of paid hourly positions as well. Please [email me](iullah@sdsu.edu) if you are interested.

#### Prospective Master's Students

I am currently seeking prospective MA students interested in the fields of [**Computational or Digital Archaeology**](https://isaacullah.github.io/What-is-Computational-Archaeology/){:target="_blank"}, [**Geoarchaeology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoarchaeology){:target="_blank"}, and [**Landscape Archaeology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_archaeology){:target="_blank"}. I am particularly interested in students with some background in GIS or other computational approaches and/or the geosciences. I have ongoing research opportunities for students interested in working in the Mediterranean region, San Diego County, or in Central Eurasia. I have active fieldwork in Southern Italy and in San Diego County, and other opportunities may also include Spain, Jordan, or Kazakhstan. Interested prospective students should [email me](iullah@sdsu.edu) to discuss potential thesis topics further. You are also advised to visit the main [Anthropology MA program page](https://anthropology.sdsu.edu/graduate/index.html){:target="_blank"} for more information about our graduate studies program.
