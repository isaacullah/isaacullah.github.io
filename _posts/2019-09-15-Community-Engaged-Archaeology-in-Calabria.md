 The piece showcases the experience of a community-engaged approach to the [archaeology of sustainabilty in the San Pasquale Valley](posts/2019-09-13-Laborscapes-and-Archaeologies-of-Sustainability) in southern Calabria. By combining ethnographic and traditional archaeological methodologies, the project has been working to establish itself as a community-serving, rather than strictly research-generating, endeavor. Their experience is showing that truly collaborative projects offer new opportunities for knowledge production and knowledge presentation about the past, and provide a platform to turn what is normally mainly an academic pursuit of knowledge into a service to stakeholders and collaborators who make the work possible in the first place. Prioritizing process, while acknowledging the need for academic capital, makes us better scientists and offers the key to engaged scholarship.
