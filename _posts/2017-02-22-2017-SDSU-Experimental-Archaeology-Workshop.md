This semester I had the distinct pleasure of working with some of our SDSU Anthropology undergraduates to plan and execute a workshop in which students could get a first-hand experience of making and using stone tools to conduct use-wear experiments. Best of all, the students obtained a grant to fund this from our campus initiative called the ["Student Success Fee"](http://bfa.sdsu.edu/financial/budget/ssfee/). This workshop was made possible through their successfull application to this program, which, in turn, derives from their own student fees. While I worked with them to develope the plan and proposal, it really was the dedication of our [undergraduate majors](http://aas.sdsu.edu/) that led to a successful outcome.

  _During the workshop, the students achieved the following learning outcomes:_

#### 1) Learned how to design scientific experiments and carry them out.

* Derived a procedure to study wear marks on a variety of stone tool types, doing a variety of activities
* Used repetition and controls to ensure scientific validity.
* Recorded all practices and methods in enough detail to ensure replicability.

#### 2) Learned the basics of lithic (stone tool) analysis.

* Learned the basic mechanics of stone tool production ("flintknapping")
* Became familiar with the stone tool morphology and typology (flakes vs. blades, flake attributes, etc.)
* Learned how to measure key attributes of stone tools (use of calipers, essential measurements, etc.)
* Learned the basics of photographic documentation and the initial stages of photometric measurements.

#### 3) Learned basic archaeological laboratory practices.

* Washing and labeling artifacts.
* Sorting artifacts by attribute.
* Basic record keeping.

#### 4) Engaged in participant observation, and reflexive scientific practice.

* Students designed their own experiments, noting also their reasoning and experiences as well as the results.
* Conducted interviews with student participants after engaging in the use of stone tools as ancient people did.
* Ensured reflexive practice and anthropological insights were integral to the activities.

I've edited a short YouTube video of the workshop, which you can watch here:

We will continue the workshop in a follow-up session in which we will analyze the cut marks on the bones and the microwear on the tools. Stay tuned!
