View my 2015 SAA presentation, entitled, [*Complexity in Space and Time: Spatio-temporal variability and scale in simulations of socio-natural systems*](/presentations/saa2015.html).

NOTE: The presentation will load in your web browser. It may take some time to initialize, so please be patient. It should work fine in any modern browser, but if you are using a really old browser (I'm looking at you, "IE on Windows XP" users), then it probably won't work.
