Ever since I started this website, I have gotten questions about the term "Computational Archaeology." Most people seem to generally understand that it has something to do with using computers and with doing archaeology, but beyond that, ideas seem to diverge fairly rapidly. A few years back, when I chose "Computational Archaeology and Neolithic Subsistence Economies" as the title for this website, I did have a very specific understanding of what I think "Computational Archaeology" actually is. However, in the time since then, I have come to discover that not only had I not invented the term, but that it was being used extensively by others in some slightly different contexts. Albeit with definite overlap with my own understanding. I will get to my own thoughts a little later in this post, but let's first start, as everything does these days, with a [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=computational+archaeology&oq=computational+archaeology&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i61l3j0.3527j0j7&client=ubuntu&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

## Focus and toolkit

As of the time of this blog post, this website sits at the number 5 position in the [Google search ranking for "Computational Archaeology."](https://www.google.com/search?q=computational+archaeology&oq=computational+archaeology&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i61l3j0.3527j0j7&client=ubuntu&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) First in the list is the [wikipedia post on Computational Archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_archaeology), then Kristina Georgieva's [Wordpress blog on becoming a Computational Archaeologist](https://computationalarchaeology.wordpress.com/), a ["How Stuff Works" article](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/archaeology/computational-archaeology.htm), and a link to the wonderful [MSc Program in Computational Archaeology at UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/study/graduate-taught/degrees/msc_comp_arch). Looking across these top five Google hits, other places around the web, conversations and paper titles at professional meetings, and in the literature, I have noticed a few trends in the way "Computational Archaeology" is defined:

1. The use of *digital data* in archaeological research.

2. The *general use of computers* in archaeological research.

3. The use of *computational algorithms to fill gaps in archaeological data* in ways that can't be done with traditional techniques.

4. The use of *simulation models and artificial intelligence* to understand the processes and dynamics of past societies.

5. The use of computer visualizations to create immersive virtual experiences of archaeological sites and materials


Various definitions will emphasize some of those subjects more than others, however, and may even ignore the rest of the list. All definitions emphasize the use of computers, but do so in different ways. I have noticed the following emphases on computer-based tools in various definitions of "Computational Archaeology":

1. GIS and geospatial data analysis

2. Digital imagery and photogrammetry

3. Statistical computing and quantitative analysis

4. Data visualization

5. Agent Based Modeling and simulation

6. 3D modeling, virtual reality, and augmented reality

7. Video gaming and digital animation


In the definitions, there is also a lot of talk about the use of "new" and "innovative" approaches, and how the field is not yet fully developed. For example, from the Wikipedia article linked above describes it as "an emerging discipline" that is "often inadequately represented in archaeological training and education." While I agree with this to some extent, I also would point out that none of the trends or even tools list above is particularly "new" any more. More truthfully, the technology and many of the basic concepts and techniques have been around for quite a long time (my whole life, for example). However, it may still be true that their impact on the field of archaeology has not yet reached a saturation point to where they are regarded as part of the "normal" toolkit of the practicing archaeologist. That being said, it is useful to quickly review the extent to which computation has penetrated the discipline.

## Organizations related to Computational Archaeology

The oldest, and perhaps most influential organization that I would associate with Computational Archaeology is the venerable [Computer Applications & Quantitative Analysis in Archaeology](https://caa-international.org/) group, or "CAA" for short. The CAA revolves around an annual conference that rotates through various countries from year to year. While, somewhat shamefully, I have never personally attended a CAA conference, I hear through the grapevine that they are a true hub of information exchange about the method, theory, and practice of pretty much everything I've listed above in terms of trends and tools used in Computational Archaeology. They publish very useful and interesting conference proceedings volumes, as well as a regular journal. In many ways, the CAA is the organization that seems to align most closely to what Computational Archaeology seems to be about.

In recent years, some interest groups have been created with in the Society for American Archaeology (SAA) that overlap with the idea of computational archaeology. Namely, these are the [Digital Data Interest Group](http://www.saa.org/ForMembers/InterestGroups/DigitalDataInterestGroup/tabid/151/Default.aspx), which focuses on the use and curation of digital archaeological data, and the [Open Science Interest Group](https://osf.io/2dfhz/), which focuses on the open-sourcing of archaeological analytical methods and the process of doing archaeology (with a heavy focus on computer-based ways of doing this). These are both groups that I am involved in. Neither purports to cover the entirety of "Computational Archaeology," but they certainly are a part of it.

[CoMSES](https://www.comses.net/), the Community for Modeling Social-Ecological Systems, is another organization that falls within our growing understanding of a "Computational Archaeology." While explicitly interdisciplinary, CoMSES has traditionally held a focus on simulating past societies via ABM techniques (and other modeling formalisms). Several of the CoMSES board members, and many community members are archaeologists. Simulation is a major focus of CoMSES.

## Other terms that are in use

There are two other related terms that are out there circulating: "Digital Archaeology" and "Cyber Archaeology." Cyber Archaeology is a term that was coined by Tom Levy at UCSD for his [UC Cyber Archaeology Lab](http://ccas.ucsd.edu/). The focus is on digital data collection and analysis in archaeology. 

More widely used, and certainly currently more popular a term than either "Cyber" or "Computational" archaeology, is "Digital Archaeology." The [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=digital+archaeology&oq=digital+arc&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i60l2j0j69i60.2127j0j9&client=ubuntu&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) results for this come back with many results, including several "institutes" and "centers" for Digital Archaeology hosted by various Universities, Non-Profits, and even some commercial outfits as well. 

In this search also comes up the journal [Digital Humanities: Digital Archaeology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-humanities/sections/digital-archaeology). I was/am/have been/will be listed as a review editor for this journal (although my name seems to have gone missing from their website at the moment), but its in a bit of flux at the moment, and its scope is, quite frankly, unclear even to me at this point. However, looking through these search results, "Digital Archaeology" seems to be understood similarly to Tom Levy's "Cyber Archaeology," in that the focus is mainly on recording archaeological data digitally (3D scans, mobile forms, photogrammetry, etc.). Here, there is a clear and large overlap with the growing trend of "Digital Humanities."

## So how do *I* define "Computational Archaeology?"

As I intimated at the top of this post, when I decided to use the term "Computational Archaeology" in the name of this site, I had a very well defined notion of it in my head. Let's first take a look at what the Merriam Webster dictionary tells about the word ["Computation"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/computation).

![/images/computation.png]

In my view, I reserve "Computational Archaeology" for *analyses* that involve any actual __calculation__. That is, I prefer definition 1a, above. In this sense, "Computational" is taken to mean "computing" or "calculating" something. This, to me, must be more than simply "using a computer," as in definition 1b, but very often *does* involve, or even requires, the use of computers. 

I break this down further into two general types of computation: 

First, there are *analytical* computations, which calculate a mathematical solution from input data. This is the realm of "scientific computing," using software such as [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or [Scientific Python](https://www.scipy.org/about.html), as well as GIS analysis with advanced tools like [GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org). Multidimensional statistics, clustering, data-mining, cross-correlation, geospatial analytics, imagery analysis, etc. are all analyses that I would put in this subcategory of Computational Archaeology. They are generally quantitative, often heuristic, and sometimes algorithmic approaches to explaining or finding patterns in data. This might be seen as the *inductive* approach to computational archaeology.

Second, are *generative* computations, which compute novelty from a set of initial conditions. This is the realm of "simulation," using modeling software like [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)  or [RePast](https://repast.github.io/). Here, the calculations being performed by the computer are generating non-linear behavior in highly algorithmic systems of interacting software agents. "Agent-Based Modeling," "genetic algorithms," "cellular automata," "stock and flow models," "dynamic equilibrium models," etc., are all within this subcategory. The point here is to be inspired by archaeological and anthropological theory and data to create dynamic, processual simulation models that produce observable behavior from first principles. This might be seen as the 8deductive* approach to computational archaeology.

Any thing that is not "computation" according to definition 1a, above, is, in my view "digital archaeology." To me, this is a better label for things that involve computers, but which are not actually *computing* anything. Digital data collection, manipulation, curation, and interaction all fall into this other category. I prefer the term "Digital" Archaeology over "Cyber" Archaeology simply because it has caught on more -- in my mind the two terms are perfectly interchangeable. This a rich and very exciting field, and one that is currently experiencing a renaissance as the price point of technologies such as UAV's, LiDAR, GPS, Mobile Tablets, and high-resolution cameras has fallen increasingly into the "consumer" realm over the last few years.

So here's how I break it all down:

| Things that you need computers for in archaeology |
|-------------------------------------------------|

| Digital Archaeology | Computational Archaeology |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Digital data collection | Quantitative data analysis |
| Data visualization | Simulation modeling |
| Data storage and manipulation | Scientific computing |




## Computers and Archaeology

At the end of this now rather lengthy blog post, I want to emphasize that I am *not* trying to be a "splitter" here. I do not want to seem to be encouraging a separation between "Computational" and "Digital" archaeology. Instead, I want to show how these two very-much-related subcomponents of computer-based archaeology articulate. On the one hand, digital archaeologists are gathering and encoding incredible amounts of data in digital formats. They are innovating methods of handling, visualizing, and qualitatively understanding these data. They are deeply embedded in the realm of technology and draw their intellectual inspirations from the digital humanities. On the other hand, computational archaeologists are expanding our ability to quantitatively interrogate data, and to understand dynamics and process that are unobservable in the archaeological record. We need to be doing both of these things. Gathering fancy digital data for fancy digital data's sake is not enough, even if we can now get a personal feeling for it through VR or gaming. Simulations and deep statistical techniques are meaningless without the appropriate type and scale of data to input or to validate them. In this way, these two approaches compliment and extend the each other's utility. 

To sum up, way back when I chose the name for this site, I had simulation modeling and geospatial analyses on the brain. The use of drones, photogrammetry, mobile tablets, and other digital technology has long been a part of my tool kit, however, even if they weren't the aspects of my work that I have emphasized over the years. Although I still like to call myself a "Computational Archaeologist," since that's still where the bulk of my interests lay, it's pretty clear that I could just as easily be called a "Digital Archaeologist" as well. Moreover, I would be very surprised if there was anyone who did *only* "Computational" archaeology and no "Digital" archaeology, and vice versa. You really can't have one without the other.

Hmmm.... Maybe I should start calling myself simply a "*Computer-Using Archaeologist*?"
